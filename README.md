Hi there! I'm **Dhahri Bilel**, a passionate Software Engineering student at ISSAT Sousse, Tunisia. My work bridges the worlds of **full-stack development**, **IoT systems**, and **robotics**, with hands-on experience building real-world applications using frameworks like **Next.js**, **Spring Boot**, **Django**, and **Flutter**. Iâ€™ve developed everything from AI-integrated robots and medical wearables to dynamic web platforms and mobile apps. I'm always experimenting with new technologies â€” currently exploring **Generative AI**, **microservices architecture**, and **real-time systems**.
